This file has a number of functions that you need to fill out in order to
complete the assignment. Please write the appropriate code, following the
instructions on which functions you may or may not use.

GENERAL RULES:
    1. DO NOT INCLUDE code that saves, shows, displays, writes the image that
    you are being passed in. Do that on your own if you need to save the images
    but the functions should NOT save the image to file.

    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from those that we provide.
    You may not import anything else, and you should be able to complete
    the assignment with the given libraries (and in many cases without them).

    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. You may NOT change function
    type signatures (not even named parameters with defaults). You may add
    additional code to this file at your discretion, however it is your
    responsibility to ensure that the autograder accepts your submission.

    4. This file has only been tested in the provided virtual environment.
    You are responsible for ensuring that your code executes properly in the
    virtual machine environment, and that any changes you make outside the
    areas annotated for student code do not impact your performance on the

        ************************************************************
          Before you start this function, read the documentation
                  for cv2.DMatch, and cv2.findHomography
        ************************************************************

    Follow these steps:

        1. Iterate through matches and store the coordinates for each
           matching keypoint in the corresponding array (e.g., the
           location of keypoints from image_1_kp should be stored in
           image_1_points).

            NOTE: Image 1 is your "query" image, and image 2 is your
                  "train" image. Therefore, you index into image_1_kp
                  using `match.queryIdx`, and index into image_2_kp
                  using `match.trainIdx`.

        2. Call cv2.findHomography() and pass in image_1_points and
           image_2_points, using method=cv2.RANSAC and
           ransacReprojThreshold=5.0.

        3. cv2.findHomography() returns two values: the homography and
           a mask. Ignore the mask and return the homography.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_1_kp : list<cv2.KeyPoint>
        A list of keypoint descriptors in the first image

    image_2_kp : list<cv2.KeyPoint>
        A list of keypoint descriptors in the second image

    matches : list<cv2.DMatch>

    Given the 8 corner points (the transformed corners of image 1 and the
    corners of image 2), we want to find the bounding rectangle that
    completely contains both images.

    Follow these steps:

        1. Use the homography to transform the perspective of the corners from
           image 1 (but NOT image 2) to get the location of the warped
           image corners.

        2. Get the boundaries in each dimension of the enclosing rectangle by
           finding the minimum x, maximum x, minimum y, and maximum y.

    Parameters
    ----------
    corners_1 : numpy.ndarray of shape (4, 1, 2)
        Output from getImageCorners function for image 1

    corners_2 : numpy.ndarray of shape (4, 1, 2)

    homography : numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float64)
        A 3x3 array defining a homography transform between image_1 and image_2

    Returns
    -------

    """Warps the input image according to the homography transform and embeds
    the result into a canvas large enough to fit the next adjacent image
    prior to blending/stitching.

    Follow these steps:

        1. Create a translation matrix (numpy.ndarray) that will shift
           the image by x_min and y_min. This looks like this:

            [[1, 0, -x_min],
             [0, 1, -y_min],
             [0, 0, 1]]

        2. Compute the dot product of your translation matrix and the
           homography in order to obtain the homography matrix with a
           translation.

        NOTE: Matrix multiplication (dot product) is not the same thing
              as the * operator (which performs element-wise multiplication).
              See Numpy documentation for details.

        3. Call cv2.warpPerspective() and pass in image 1, the combined
           translation/homography transform matrix, and a vector describing
           the dimensions of a canvas that will fit both images.

        NOTE: cv2.warpPerspective() is touchy about the type of the output
              shape argument, which should be an integer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : numpy.ndarray
        A grayscale or color image (test cases only use uint8 channels)

    homography : numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float64)
        A 3x3 array defining a homography transform between two sequential
        images in a panorama sequence

    min_xy : numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float64)
        2x1 array containing the coordinates of the top left corner of a
        canvas large enough to fit the warped input image and the next
        image in a panorama sequence

    max_xy : numpy.ndarray(dtype=np.float64)
        2x1 array containing the coordinates of the bottom right corner of
        a canvas large enough to fit the warped input image and the next
        image in a panorama sequence

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray(dtype=image.dtype)
        An array containing the warped input image embedded in a canvas
        large enough to join with the next image in the panorama; the output
        type should match the input type (following the convention of
        cv2.warpPerspective)

    -----

        by negative 1 in your writeup.

        You MUST replace the basic insertion blend provided here to earn
                         credit for this function.

       The most common implementation is to use alpha blending to take the
       average between the images for the pixels that overlap, but you are
                    encouraged to use other approaches.

                  Above & Beyond credit on this assignment.

    ----------
    image_1 : numpy.ndarray
        A grayscale or color image
